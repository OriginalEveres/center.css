# center.css | Solcode's library

We believe that most developers are fully capable of coding this simple code, but it could be so boring to rewrite all the code, so here we go with this simple library!

Feel free to use it in your project!

# How to implement in your project
Implementing our CSS library is pretty easy. All you have to do is just link the CSS file and asign the clasess to your elements.
